# SCART-Splitter
This is a simple SCART splitter based on the THS7374.
The circuit is is AC-bias mode so component video will be properly driven. It can be easily adapted for a variety of connectors; RCA, BNC, VGA, whatever you need.

This was loosely based on Voultar's open source [Dual Output board.](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/6o0jvLnD)
Special thanks also to RetroRGB; thanks to examining the 2DVI boards I gained a better understanding of these circuits.
